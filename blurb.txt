ABOUT ME
I’m a graphic designer with a passion for creating visually compelling work that blends creativity, strategy, and technology. I have experience in social media design, brand identity and development, and replicating established branding and marketing styles with precision and consistency.
With hands-on experience using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Procreate, and Figma — along with working knowledge of Premiere Pro and After Effects — I enjoy bringing ideas to life across both digital and visual platforms. I hold a degree in Informatics and have a strong interest in coding and technology, which allows me to approach design with both creativity and logic.
Graphic design is where my two passions — art and technology — come together. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my skills, and my drive to grow as a designer only continues to deepen. For me, design isn’t just work — it’s how I create, problem-solve, and tell stories visually.



ABOUT ARISE
Arise is a treatment center dedicated to empowering individuals and families through compassionate, person-centered recovery care. Built on the belief that healing looks different for everyone, Arise focuses on creating a supportive, structured environment that encourages growth, accountability, and long-term success. The organization exists to not only treat addiction, but to restore hope, dignity, and purpose in the lives of those it serves.

ABOUT ARISE LOGO CONCEPT 
Arise’s logo was intentionally designed to represent both an “A” and a mountain, symbolizing strength, stability, and upward growth. The dual meaning reflects the journey of recovery — overcoming obstacles while striving toward new heights. Every element was crafted with purpose, from the form and structure to the color choices, ensuring the mark feels bold yet approachable. The final logo balances modern design with meaningful symbolism, creating an identity that visually communicates resilience, hope, and transformation at first glance.

ABOUT TROI 
Troi is an indoor navigation app designed for schools and event centers to make navigation safer, faster, and more intuitive. In addition to guiding users through complex buildings, Troi features an integrated emergency reporting system — setting it apart by combining wayfinding with real-time safety support. The brand and mobile experience were designed entirely from the ground up, including the logo, color system, typography, and UI/UX design, resulting in a cohesive and user-focused product that prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and security. Troi is built at the intersection of design, technology, and safety, with the goal of creating smarter, safer spaces.

ABOUT TROI LOGO BREAKDOWN
Troi’s brand identity was built from the concept of movement, protection, and purpose. Inspired by the Greek meaning of “Troy” as footsoldier, the logo was developed from a single, foot-like form and duplicated to create a symbol that visually represents motion and forward progress. The result is a mark that feels dynamic and directional while remaining simple and modern. The color palette was chosen to create a sense of comfort, clarity, and approachability, reinforcing trust in an environment where safety matters most. Every design choice — from the logo to the UI — was created to support a brand that feels strong, reassuring, and forward-thinking.

MCALISTERS BLURB
As a Catering Coordinator at McAlister’s Deli, I also managed in-store marketing and promotional design. I created posters, displays, and visual materials to support seasonal promotions and catering initiatives while maintaining strict adherence to brand guidelines. This experience strengthened my ability to replicate existing brand identities with accuracy, ensuring all marketing materials felt seamless, professional, and on-brand. My work demonstrates an understanding of visual consistency, hierarchy, and layout within a real-world retail environment where design directly supports business goals.

ATC SOCIAL BLURB
The goal of Arise’s social media presence was to create a clean, modern, and easily digestible visual identity that both motivates and informs. Each post was intentionally designed to reflect the organization’s mission while remaining approachable and consistent across platforms. By incorporating curated quotes through Canva alongside custom edits and original brand photography, the content strategy emphasized clarity, emotional connection, and brand recognition. The result is a cohesive social media presence that communicates Arise’s values while building trust and engagement with its audience.
